# field-guide-default-template

This is a template designed to work with [field-guide](https://github.com/empress/field-guide) and is a fully-functional, static site implementation of a documentation site built on EmberJS with fully working out of the box SEO friendly output. It supports being hosted on Netlify, Github Pages, AWS S3 or any other static site hosting solution.

For more information on how to use this system [read the Field Guide documentation](https://github.com/empress/field-guide#readme) but if you want to get started straight away, try the quick start below.

If you want an example of this "in production" then check out the [Ember Styleguide](https://ember-styleguide.netlify.app). If you use this in production let me know [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/real_ate) and I can add a "built with field-guide" wiki.

You do not need to be a web developer to be able to use this system. You just write markdown files and the rest of the work is performed by EmberJS' build system.

## Quick Start

```sh
npm init ember-addon super-addon

cd super-addon

ember install field-guide field-guide-default-template
```

It will ask you if you want to update the `index.html` file and you should say yes üëç

If you want to see Field Guide running on your local machine just run `npm start` and you will be able to navigate to  [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to see the system in action.
